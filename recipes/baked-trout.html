    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>How to bake a hopefully tasty trout.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cleaned trout</li>
      <li>bacon</li>
      <li>garlic (or garlic power)</li>
      <li>butter</li>
      <li>cayenne (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Clean the trout and wrap each fish in a very thin slice of bacon,
        sprinkled with minced garlic (or garlic powder), and seasoned with
        cayenne (optional).
      </li>
      <li>Cut a thin slice of butter and set in the middle of the trout.</li>
      <li>
        Enclose each fish in foil, cut larger than to fit so there is some
        overlap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay the trout in a pan, and bake them in the foil at 350 F/175 C for 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        To confirm the fish is finished, the skin of the trout should peel
        easily from the meat.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from foil and serve.</li>
    </ol>
